For the famous Titanic dataset, I've created two classification models with two different approaches - logit model with initial assumptions for variable selection
and a bit of feature engineering while using boosted tree algorithm and tuning hyperaparameters (ML approach) for the second model. 
Both models are used to predict if each passenger survived.
