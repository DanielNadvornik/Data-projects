From the last week of January, I did several waves of Twitter sentiment and general analysis of tweets with relevant KW's, such as Putin, NATO or Russia. 
So far, I've used english and russian lexiconns for sentiment analysis, created multiple plots (density, time series, barplot) and used them to further explore the nature of a hybrid war.
